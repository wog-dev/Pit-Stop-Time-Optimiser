# Pit-Stop-Time-Optimiser
A Python command line tool that calculates the total time spent in pit stops during a race and expresses it as a percentage of the total race time.
The user inputs the total race time, number of pit stops, and average pit stop duration. The programme then calculates whether the pit crew performed efficiently based on the results.
